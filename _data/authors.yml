  bio: "Shawn Coots works as a product manager but would rather be writing. He collects comic books, knows too much about Star Wars mythology, and plays guitar at a skill level somewhere past offensive. Now that he and his lovely wife (and editor) have two young children, the guitars and comic books mostly collect dust."
