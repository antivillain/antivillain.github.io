description: "ANTI-VILLAIN is a fictional imprint I use to publish my work. I'm a Product Manager by day, aspiring author by night. In my career I've worked as a designer, developer, and product leader. I'm fond of comics, know entirely too much about Star Wars mythology, and play guitar at a skill level just past offensive. Thanks for visiting!"
