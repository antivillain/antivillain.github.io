The match wasn’t going over with the crowd, forcing the two burly curtain-jerkers to hightail it out of there before the fans decided to throw something worse.\n\nWhen the heckling grew to a near-deafening volume, a suited, mustachioed man crawled through the bottom rope as quickly as he was able, with a microphone in hand.\n\n“And now, ladies and gentlemen…” rumbled over the gym’s dated sound system.\n\nFrom behind the curtain, Tony shouted, “See you out there, shit-bird!” while flipping his opponent off.\n\n“… tonight’s main event!”\n\n“Fuck you too, T,” Sam muttered, returning Tony’s bird with both hands.\n\n“…introducing the challenger, weighing in at 285 pounds, hailing from Death Valley, Nevada…”\n\nThe wrestler poured water over his greasy black locks, pulling them from his forehead with a meaty hand. From behind a ratty green curtain, the distorted F-chord of Tony’s entrance music roared over the P.A. The drapes blew wide open, revealing:\n\n“…TONY SWITCHBLADE!!!”\n\nA unified jeer erupted, louder than Tony thought possible from this backwoods gymnasium. An empty soda can bounced off of his pectorals, but that didn’t slow his strut down the ramp. With his glistening, tree-trunk arms outstretched, he paused to revel in the chorus of boos. Being evil was the job, and Tony Switchblade took it very seriously.\n\nHe exuded physical superiority over the flabby heathens in attendance, humiliating them with his commanding presence. Behind thin slits, Tony’s eyes darted back and forth over the crowd, searching for just the right mark. In the third row, there was a sandy-haired kid no older than 12, standing by his worthless old man. The kid’s face was red-hot from shouting fifth-grade-level insults at Tony. Switchblade passed them by at first but paused. Slowly, he turned toward the child with a menacing grin that revealed clenched teeth — teeth that seemed like they might crack under strain, as evidenced by the veins extruding from Tony’s neck. The crowd knew full well what would happen next, but no one volunteered to stop it, not even the boy’s father.\n\nSwitchblade closed the space between them, pushing in on the boy until their noses were touching. All the kid’s screaming and bravado died immediately upon contact. But intimidating the boy wasn’t enough for Switchblade, not by a long shot.\n\nHe raised his closed fist high above the boy’s head, and when it opened to reveal an actual switchblade knife, the crowd squealed in terror, as did the boy. The blade flicked open, gleaming in the floodlight. Tony held it there a moment, then leveled it with his own throat, dragging the back of the knife across his flesh, slow and mean, without blinking. Then Tony got what he selfishly hoped for: a single tear rolled down the kid’s cheek, signaling to his spineless father to yank him out of their little interchange. In an instant, Tony ran up to the ring, ascending to the top rope with ease, then held his blade high. The back of his ass read Switchblade in airbrushed neon.\n\nSeveral of the flunkies in the front few rows shouted half-hearted threats of violence and a few insults regarding his mother, to which he responded with a string of artful profanities before his music died down. There was a moment of calm before the forgotten mustachioed man in the far corner raised his mic again.\n\n“And introducing his opponent, the heavyweight champion of the GFW…”\n\nAnd that was as far as he got before Tony steamrolled over him, snatching the microphone right out of his sweaty hands. Mustache fell square on his giant-sized ass, then scooted backward like a dog defiling the rug.\n\n“That’s about enough out of you, JimJam! Get out of my ring while you still have legs!”\n\nMr. Mustache did precisely that, fumbling like a frightened child on his way out. Tony’s voice was jagged glass that’d cut your ears, almost as if he’d been chewing on nails while smoking dynamite for at least 20 years.\n\nHe smiled and screamed, “Sammy Strongman, you’ve got nowhere to run, you spineless, yellow coward! You can’t hide that belt behind your stupid fans any longer. C’mon down here so I can show these shifty layabouts the color of your blood!” Tony flicked open his switchblade again, staring at the shiny blade as if possessed by it. “I’m going mess you up, brother, but good! Slit you from gut to gizzard!” Tony pointed the blade over the ropes toward the announce table. “Play his damn music already, before I cut you too!”\n\nPlay the music they did, and the crowd erupted. Everyone in attendance leaped to their feet, waiting for a glimpse of the champ they’d all came to see. Meanwhile, a nervous referee joined Tony in the ring, requesting the knife. Tony made the ref flinch a couple of times before handing the blade over, laughing at his fear.\n\nAs the music swelled, once again, the ratty green curtain parted — this time revealing Tony’s polar opposite. Brightly colored boots and trunks, handsome features, and shiny blonde hair adorned Sammy Strongman, whose physique gave credence to his surname. He looked stout enough to twist Tony’s head right off his goddamn neck. Despite Switchblade’s harsh words, Sammy was all smiles as he descended the ramp slowly, high-fiving every kid along the way. He even ruffled the kid’s hair that Tony had frightened, whispering words of encouragement up close. The kid looked over at his pop as if to confirm what just happened. No one at school would believe him when he recounted the story the next day.\n\nStrongman and Switchblade stared one another down from opposite sides of the ropes. Strongman finally entered the ring, keeping an eye on his wily opponent. The ensuing match told a story that built slowly. Over the next 48 minutes, the two men put on an impressive display of huge spots and brutal reversals, seemingly destroying their bodies one part at a time. Just when Sammy gained the upper hand, Tony would take a cheap shot, seizing control. In the end, Sammy Strongman had Tony right where he wanted him. As soon as the ref was distracted, Switchblade retrieved the brass knuckles he’d hidden in his trunks, hitting Sammy’s left temple with the foreign object. Unaware of the cheat, the referee counted three, leaving the crowd devastated. Tony raised the former champ’s belt high overhead, his foot on Sammy’s chest as he lay unconscious and defeated in the middle of the ring.\n\nThe crowd fell silent as it sank in that Sammy had lost to the bad guy. They soon found their anger, erupting in unison for the loudest heat Tony had ever heard. He made his escape, briefly wondering if a wrestler had ever been murdered by a gang of livid fans.\n\nEventually, Sammy rose from the mat, blood streaming down his face. It was a ghastly sight, but Sammy smiled through the pain. He grabbed the mic, then assured the crowd that at next week’s show, he’d get back what was rightfully his. The audience only had to drive down to Memphis to see the action. With the roar of the crowd surrounding him, Sammy flexed his oily body into pose after pose. And with that, the show was over.\n\n[Read more here](/projects/i-saw-a-stranger-on-the-freeway/)","src/content/blog/kayfabe-excert.md","a224489b28d28f9b",{"html":100,"metadata":101},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/img/blog-kayfabe.webp\" alt=\"Wrestling\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Restless and rowdy fans of GFW Wrestling filled the gymnasium of Red Bank High to capacity, hurling paper cups half-full of RC Cola and fistfuls of stale popcorn at the faded blue ring.

Slit you from gut to gizzard!” Tony pointed the blade over the ropes toward the announce table. “Play his damn music already, before I cut you too!”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Play the music they did, and the crowd erupted. Everyone in attendance leaped to their feet, waiting for a glimpse of the champ they’d all came to see. Meanwhile, a nervous referee joined Tony in the ring, requesting the knife. Tony made the ref flinch a couple of times before handing the blade over, laughing at his fear.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As the music swelled, once again, the ratty green curtain parted — this time revealing Tony’s polar opposite. Brightly colored boots and trunks, handsome features, and shiny blonde hair adorned Sammy Strongman, whose physique gave credence to his surname. He looked stout enough to twist Tony’s head right off his goddamn neck. Despite Switchblade’s harsh words, Sammy was all smiles as he descended the ramp slowly, high-fiving every kid along the way. He even ruffled the kid’s hair that Tony had frightened, whispering words of encouragement up close. The kid looked over at his pop as if to confirm what just happened. No one at school would believe him when he recounted the story the next day.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Strongman and Switchblade stared one another down from opposite sides of the ropes. Strongman finally entered the ring, keeping an eye on his wily opponent. The ensuing match told a story that built slowly. Over the next 48 minutes, the two men put on an impressive display of huge spots and brutal reversals, seemingly destroying their bodies one part at a time. Just when Sammy gained the upper hand, Tony would take a cheap shot, seizing control. In the end, Sammy Strongman had Tony right where he wanted him. As soon as the ref was distracted, Switchblade retrieved the brass knuckles he’d hidden in his trunks, hitting Sammy’s left temple with the foreign object. Unaware of the cheat, the referee counted three, leaving the crowd devastated. Tony raised the former champ’s belt high overhead, his foot on Sammy’s chest as he lay unconscious and defeated in the middle of the ring.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The crowd fell silent as it sank in that Sammy had lost to the bad guy. They soon found their anger, erupting in unison for the loudest heat Tony had ever heard. He made his escape, briefly wondering if a wrestler had ever been murdered by a gang of livid fans.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eventually, Sammy rose from the mat, blood streaming down his face. It was a ghastly sight, but Sammy smiled through the pain. He grabbed the mic, then assured the crowd that at next week’s show, he’d get back what was rightfully his. The audience only had to drive down to Memphis to see the action. With the roar of the crowd surrounding him, Sammy flexed his oily body into pose after pose. And with that, the show was over.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"/projects/i-saw-a-stranger-on-the-freeway/\">Read more here\u003C/a>\u003C/p>",{"headings":102,"imagePaths":103,"frontmatter":104},[],[],{"title":86,"excerpt":87,"publishDate":105,"tags":106,"seo":107},"Jul 09 2022",[91],{"image":108},{"src":94,"alt":95},"kayfabe-excert.md","cleanest-gas-station-excert",{"id":110,"data":112,"body":121,"filePath":122,"digest":123,"rendered":124,"legacyId":133},{"title":113,"excerpt":114,"publishDate":115,"isFeatured":89,"tags":116,"seo":117},"The Cleanest Gas Station Bathroom in all of Georgia","An insecure photographer chases fame, but finds something more sinister.

Stephen noticed a sly smile from his agent. Julia’s meticulous plan to invite the perfect guest list had been a smashing success. While Stephen didn’t recognize everyone, a few notable attendees caught his eye. In the far corner of the gallery where his centerpiece hung stood none other than Blue Herring and Tricky Lix — two artists that “got him through college,” as he would later be quoted in an article for Juxtapoz magazine.\n\nStephen Grant thought about striking up a conversation with his former heroes, himself vying to join their elusive club — but that felt thirsty. “Let them come to me, or not at all,” he muttered between sips of alembic brandy, “it’s my goddamned moment.” Scanning the room, Stephen noticed more than a few eager faces he assumed had burning questions or designs for climbing the social ladder. Wishing to remain mysterious and elusive, he rushed into conversation with his agent in the opposite corner.\n\n“How’s your champagne, Julia?” He asked.\n\n“Chilled and bubbly, how else would it be?” She replied. “Have you been making the rounds? I have two interviews scheduled before we head to the afterparty.”\n\n“Let me polish off another brandy before you unleash the bloggers.”\n\n“Drink fast, before they grow fickle, but don’t drink too fast and then shoot your mouth off like last time,” she scolded, recalling his last, unfortunately controversial, interview. “If all goes well, by this time tomorrow, there should be enough think-pieces published to put your book on every Eames coffee table in Manhattan.”\n\n“I eagerly await my place in haut monde. Remind me again, what’s your percentage of the sales?” Stephen rhetorically quizzed.\n\n“Not what I’m worth, I assure you. Don’t look, but I believe Blue Herring is headed this way.”\n\n“Who?” Stephen joked. The expression on Julia’s face was not one of amusement.\n\n“Be nice. He still has clout.”\n\n“Yes, but for how long?” He asked, then turned, ready for anything Blue might dish out. Art was a war of pettiness, after all.\n\nUp close, Blue Herring appeared weathered and used up, his trademark Manic-Panic Blue mane thinning away while his middle thickened. The familiar black overalls didn’t do enough to disguise this. Blue’s outward aesthetic had been described as a clash of Goth and redneck, or “Blackneck,” as Rolling Stone coined it in an early profile. Stephen did, in fact, admire him while in college, but Blue hadn’t exhibited anything of interest in at least three years, which may as well have been three decades. The art world he inhabited was nothing if not cruel, and it always asked: “What have you done for me lately?”\n\nAlthough Blue had posted up directly in front of Stephen, he continued fingering at his phone in silence. The way he used only his index finger was the clearest indicator of his age. Just as Stephen’s curiosity began to wane, Blue locked eyes with him, then gestured toward the photo hanging behind him.\n\n“On behalf of my dear friend, Tricky — who rightfully felt the need to excuse herself from your party — I must ask you a question concerning this photograph.”\n\n“Ask away, Mr. Herring, but if you’re looking to purchase, I’m afraid that print has been sold,” Stephen said.\n\n“To a tasteless dolt, I’d imagine. I’m afraid I won’t be financially supporting your thievery,” Blue replied hastily. “Rather, I’m here to offer a critique.”\n\n“Come again? Thievery?”\n\n“Observe this photograph, Mr. Grant, taken by one Tricky Lix in June of ’76.” Blue held his phone inches from Stephen’s reddening face.\n\n“Surely you see the similarities in composition and subject matter, yes? Two bathroom stalls are captured, both covered in graffiti and expletives, complete with phone numbers and seedy invitations for affairs of the flesh. Tricky’s series on the underground was the original, rooted in the sordid clubs that resided mere blocks from here in the not so distant past. So, I ask the supposed artist responsible for this particular photo — what makes yours unique, and not just an insulting carbon-copy?”\n\nStephen took a step backward from Blue’s screen. A small crowd of curious onlookers gathered, pining for drama. Herring’s thick drawl added a bothersome sharpness to his accusations, but Stephen refused to let that rattle him. He simply turned from Herring, facing his piece head-on, and let his hands rest on his hips. Blue Herring had no idea who he had just fucked with.\n\n“To call this picture a copy suggests you aren’t looking closely enough, Blue. I need you to really pay attention, examine the picture for the story I’m telling.” Stephen draped an arm over Blue’s shoulder, pulling him closer to the photograph. The pressure on Blue’s neck lit up the veins in his forehead and was most assuredly intentional.\n\n“The geography is crucial to unlocking the message of my piece. You see, this particular bathroom stall is located on the backside of the Save-A-Stop, off of I-23 outside of Waycross, Georgia. The illicit messages seen in this stall are primarily homosexual in nature, scribbled in secret for the most part. Secondarily, these invitations were written in desperation, not desire — all to fund the next fix. The community in which this photo and all the others were taken is overrun with opioid addiction, after all.”\n\nBlue squirmed beneath Stephen’s arm, but he held him there, saying, “When venturing that far south, you also notice the climate as it relates to homosexuals. Didn’t you grow up in some podunk town in Kentucky? ‘Pinecone’ or something? Surely you can relate?”\n\n“I did, and can, but can you?” Blue replied shortly.\n\nStephen flatly ignored his question. “Consider Tricky’s portrait — the location being the cultural Mecca of the free world, at the height of sexual exploration no less. Yes, the punk club is dirty, but by design. The Save-A-Stop isn’t just dirty, it’s dilapidated, and much like the community it resides in, it’s on the brink of collapse. Both of our photographs contain offers of gratuitous sex acts, but what I’ve captured on film tells a story altogether different from Ms. Lix. It’s freedom of the exploratory kind, versus desperate slavery to addiction, don’t you see?” he concluded at last.\n\nBlue forcefully removed himself from Stephen’s aggressive embrace, then took a step back. He regarded his foe for a moment before declaring, “Perhaps, but it’s not your story to tell, now is it?”\n\nWith his criticisms spoken, Blue Herring exited the gallery. Stephen regained his sense of the room, noticing the curious stares. He looked to Julia, who disrupted the awkwardness with an afterparty announcement — which wisely included the last-minute addition of an open bar.\n\nThe gamble worked, as nothing silences schadenfreude like free alcohol. Two potent party pills and seven cocktails later, Stephen had flushed his former idol’s critique from his mind. As he lay in bed the next morning, he considered his first big opening a success. And in reality it would’ve been — if not for Blue Herring.\n\n[Read more here](/projects/i-saw-a-stranger-on-the-freeway/)","src/content/blog/cleanest-gas-station-excert.md","317d39ade62290e1",{"html":125,"metadata":126},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/img/blog-cleanest.webp\" alt=\"The Cleanest in Georgia\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The SARDINE gallery was filled with the right blend of glitterati taste-makers and upstart scene-snobs — each desperate to mix in with NYC’s old guard of art elite.

Also, it was one of the most boring, as $300 shades didn’t sell very often at the poorest mall in town. Despite the insane amount of foot traffic that circled my booth from all sides, I mostly functioned as a living mall directory, pointing confused seniors and lost children toward the food court.\n\nTo stave off my boredom, I became fast friends with the employees of the gothic clothing store chain across the hall. On one particularly slow Sunday, Gene (manager of the goth store) brought over his Arby’s lunch to sit on my counter. This was fairly common — I got to use their bathroom, they could eat on my counter. I vividly remember he had curly fries, horsey sauce, and a gigantic cup of Big Red, as I was starving and didn’t get a break for another hour.\n\nGene was well into his shift and his fucks-to-give were long gone. Mid-way through our usual game of “spot-the-sketchy-neck-tattoo”, Gene spotted a beefy redneck shouting “Jesus” propaganda into the entrance of his store. The redneck — complete with shit-kickers, cowboy hat, and a nearly emptied margarita purchased from the food court — had his proud mother and underaged girlfriend in tow.\n\nThe redneck would walk by on a loop every couple of minutes with new phrases to shout, like “Jesus loves you” and, my personal favorite, “Go to HELL, DEVIL WORSHIPPING F@GGOTS!” His words, not mine.\n\nAs the mom and girlfriend giggled in delight, Gene was boiling hot. He had to deal with this sort of moron fairly often, but today, he’d had enough of that shit.\n\nOn the redneck’s fourth tirade — this one involving goat sacrifices or something of the like — Gene had to fight back. “No one worships Satan in there, man. We just sell black clothes. Jesus isn’t real.”\n\nThe redneck ignored Gene and kept slurring and strutting along. Moments later he was back with a fresh margarita in hand. As his underaged girlfriend stole a sip, the redneck shouted another complaint. “What do you shit-heads have against Jesus? Get the fuck out of my mall!”\n\nTime shifted into slow-motion as Gene exploded from the counter top, shouting “You don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about, goddamn redneck! You get the FUCK out of here before I beat your ass!”\n\nThe Redneck kept walking, calling Gene every homophobic name in the book. It was at this point Gene said “Keep walking then, PUSSY!”\n\nWhen the Redneck heard he’d been called a pussy, he finally spun around, playing the “What’d you say to me?” card. Gene had a different kind of reply ready this time, hurling the giant Big Red soda directly at him, taking out the mom, the girlfriend, and the redneck, in one fell swoop.\n\nThe Redneck’s shit-kickers slipped on the delicious soda, taking the mom and the girlfriend to the ground with him. He tried over and over to get up, looking like a baby trying to escape a crib. When he finally stood up, Gene was ready and waiting with a cocked fist.\n\nAt this point, I wondered, should I jump over the booth and help Gene? The Redneck outweighed him by a good fifty pounds or so. Meanwhile, Gene’s other two employees were standing at the door, eagerly watching. The redneck charged at Gene like a crazed bull, but Gene drew back and fired off a nasty right-hook to the redneck’s jaw. That planted his drunk ass firmly on the ground, where Gene continued to pummel him. The redneck mounted an offense, swinging at thin air.\n\nHuffy, a 17 year-old goth store employee, ran to the fray, getting a rib-kick or two in before realizing he was still on the clock. He then ran backwards into the store. Gene laughed manically at this, continuing to smash the redneck’s face while the mom and girlfriend cried and shouted. The redneck continued to talk shit through his bloodied mouth. Gene kept on hammering the redneck until mall security pulled him off.\n\nCops showed up, filed a report, the whole bit. They found the redneck in the wrong, because he blew over the limit thanks to his many Margaritas. I think he was permanently banned from the mall. Gene, however, skated by with no consequences, other than a set of bruised knuckles.\n\nI’m pretty sure we talked about the fight for at least two months after that. It was certainly the highlight of working at that shithole mall. Every time I go Christmas shopping, I can’t help but think of that Big Red sailing through the air. Gene was an absolute hero that day.\n\nSometimes I wonder what the Redneck’s side of the story was. What did he tell his friends? He got ambushed by a group of devil-worshipers? He held his own until the cops pulled him off? You should see the other guy? Whatever the version, it’s probably far from the truth — that he came to the mall, got drunk, and acted like a total asshole until it got his ass good and kicked.\n\nAlthough it was brief, it was the best fight I’ve ever seen. It was comical, but most importantly, no one died or got seriously injured. So, gentle reader, what’s the best fight you’ve ever seen?\n\nHappy holidays!","src/content/blog/mall-fight.md","324bebef3c88c561",{"html":151,"metadata":152},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/img/blog-fight.webp\" alt=\"Mall Fight\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As we are plagued once again by the holiday shopping nightmare, our malls have begun their descent into the hellish chaos that capitalism demands.

The redneck mounted an offense, swinging at thin air.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Huffy, a 17 year-old goth store employee, ran to the fray, getting a rib-kick or two in before realizing he was still on the clock. He then ran backwards into the store. Gene laughed manically at this, continuing to smash the redneck’s face while the mom and girlfriend cried and shouted. The redneck continued to talk shit through his bloodied mouth. Gene kept on hammering the redneck until mall security pulled him off.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Cops showed up, filed a report, the whole bit. They found the redneck in the wrong, because he blew over the limit thanks to his many Margaritas. I think he was permanently banned from the mall. Gene, however, skated by with no consequences, other than a set of bruised knuckles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’m pretty sure we talked about the fight for at least two months after that. It was certainly the highlight of working at that shithole mall. Every time I go Christmas shopping, I can’t help but think of that Big Red sailing through the air. Gene was an absolute hero that day.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sometimes I wonder what the Redneck’s side of the story was. What did he tell his friends? He got ambushed by a group of devil-worshipers? He held his own until the cops pulled him off? You should see the other guy? Whatever the version, it’s probably far from the truth — that he came to the mall, got drunk, and acted like a total asshole until it got his ass good and kicked.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although it was brief, it was the best fight I’ve ever seen. It was comical, but most importantly, no one died or got seriously injured.

He’s proven himself on screen as a legit badass, earning praise from the film industry and audiences, but also from the stunt coordinators behind the scenes.

With the demands of his stunts, he maintains a high level of physical fitness through weight training and martial arts.\n\nGiven these amazing feats of strength, it’s easy to imagine that Keanu is very in-tune with his mind and body. He projects the humble presence of a man who is at peace.\n\nThen there’s Tom Cruise, who was once described by Rob Lowe as such: “He’s open, friendly, funny, and has an almost robotic, bloodless focus and an intensity that I’ve never encountered before... he’s zeroed in like a laser.” I don’t think another quote more accurately sums the man up. You’ve seen his insane stunts that would kill most people. He seems to have a near-psychotic drive to push himself beyond the limits of mortal men. While he doesn’t have as much hand-to-hand combat training as Reeves, he did study Krav Maga for the Mission Impossible films. The main thing to consider about Cruise as your opponent is this - the man prepares. For Top Gun, he learned to fly fighter jets. He can ride a motorcycle off the side of a cliff and parachute to safety. He regularly spends time hanging from the exterior of planes while they’re in flight.

I'm sure the proprietor had dialed 911 the second he stopped pissing himself.\n\nAgainst my better judgment, we carried on, shooting two takes of the scene. Then, we vacated the premises for an empty church parking lot down the street. I pulled off the mask, which now smelled like a gym sock. We stowed the false weaponry and masks back in the trunk. While planning our next move I spotted an unmarked Crown Vic, speeding into the parking lot. A plainclothes cop sprang from the door with her gun drawn. Before I could really wrap my head around the image, another set of tires came screeching to a halt behind me. Over my shoulder was a second, uniformed cop, large and angry looking - also with a gun pointing my way.\n\nThere was an instinctual fear that took over. They might've told us to raise our hands, but I didn't hear it, they just went up automatically. Before I could get a word out in defense, I was spread eagle against Jimmy's car. Questions were barked our way by the cops, the first guns closer, as they patted us down for weapons. I was looking to Jimmy to pull us out of the shit, but he was a blank slate.\n\nAs usual, it fell on me to do the talking. I explained that we were filming a parody movie and that our guns (and dynamite) were fakes. The cop in uniform rummaged through the trunk.

Comparatively speaking - growing up in the pre-internet ‘80s - the world still held a certain type of mystique. Our exposure to the unknown consisted of intermittent network TV specials about topics such as the Bermuda Triangle or the Loch Ness Monster. As such, our imaginations often ran wild in regard mysteries of this strange planet.\n\nAround age 11, I became a skeptic, leaving behind my fascination with the unexplained. I doubted everything from Bigfoot to God. There simply was no such thing as aliens, Santa Claus, or an afterlife where the streets are gold and you aren’t sad anymore about your dead pets.\n\nHaving this newfound perspective, I wanted to validate it with someone who’d been around the sun a few times and had a validated opinion. That person was my dad.\n\nTo get a sense of my father as a person, it’s important to understand that he’s not a storyteller. He’s incapable of bullshit. Watching a movie with him is an exercise in frustration because he retains no detail, plot, or characters the moment the credits appear. As such, I trusted he would answer my questions honestly because he was incapable of spinning a yarn. I don’t have many clear memories from around this age, but the following tale has stuck with me through the fog of time.\n\nI remember one day he was in the living room of our old house, throwing a log into the fire.\n\n“Dad,” I asked, “have you ever seen a ghost?”\n\nHe threw another log into the fire without looking in my direction. “Yep, sure have,” he answered without hesitation.\n\nThat was not the answer I had expected and was naturally shocked. When he did turn around, he immediately saw it on my face. I sat on the floor near the fireplace as he pulled up a stool. For the one and only time in our relationship, it was story time.\n\nIn the early ‘70s, my eighteen-year-old father was a bricklayer working with his brother’s construction crew. They’d been hired for a job to build a small house on a large plot of land in Madison, Kentucky. Driving in, my father was struck by how thick with trees the forest was. They brought camping gear with them to stay on-site since it was so remote.\n\nThat was as much of a scene as he was able to set. Again, not much of a storyteller, my dad. The story did get more interesting when he told me sleeping in the tent on the first night, he was awoken by a shotgun blast. He peeped his head outside the flap and saw his brother and a couple of the other workers. \"Get back in the tent, Eddie!\" His brother shouted. After a while, he went back to sleep.\n\nThe next day, he asked his brother what the hell all the commotion was about, but he had nothing to say. In my whole life, I think I can count on one hand the number of words I've heard my uncle utter, so this made sense. Dad brushed it off thinking maybe they were shooting at a coyote or something of the like.\n\nOn the second night, dad had not so much as settled in his sleeping bag when he heard a strange, blood-curdling noise. Not content to stay in the tent this time, he crawled out to investigate. There again were his brother and another man, firing off a shotgun into the distance. It was then that he saw it. An eerie white light pulsed about ten feet away from them. It hovered, the shots having no effect. As it neared them, the men backed away in fear. My dad stood frozen, unable to square what he was seeing. It was in the shape of a man, but featureless, he described. Eventually, as if it grew bored, it faded back into the night.\n\nMy dad and his brother continued work on the house for another month but didn't see the light again.

Comparatively speaking - growing up in the pre-internet ‘80s - the world still held a certain type of mystique. Our exposure to the unknown consisted of intermittent network TV specials about topics such as the Bermuda Triangle or the Loch Ness Monster. As such, our imaginations often ran wild in regard mysteries of this strange planet.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Around age 11, I became a skeptic, leaving behind my fascination with the unexplained. I doubted everything from Bigfoot to God. There simply was no such thing as aliens, Santa Claus, or an afterlife where the streets are gold and you aren’t sad anymore about your dead pets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Having this newfound perspective, I wanted to validate it with someone who’d been around the sun a few times and had a validated opinion. That person was my dad.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To get a sense of my father as a person, it’s important to understand that he’s not a storyteller. He’s incapable of bullshit. Watching a movie with him is an exercise in frustration because he retains no detail, plot, or characters the moment the credits appear. As such, I trusted he would answer my questions honestly because he was incapable of spinning a yarn. I don’t have many clear memories from around this age, but the following tale has stuck with me through the fog of time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I remember one day he was in the living room of our old house, throwing a log into the fire.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Dad,” I asked, “have you ever seen a ghost?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He threw another log into the fire without looking in my direction. “Yep, sure have,” he answered without hesitation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That was not the answer I had expected and was naturally shocked. When he did turn around, he immediately saw it on my face. I sat on the floor near the fireplace as he pulled up a stool. For the one and only time in our relationship, it was story time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the early ‘70s, my eighteen-year-old father was a bricklayer working with his brother’s construction crew. They’d been hired for a job to build a small house on a large plot of land in Madison, Kentucky. Driving in, my father was struck by how thick with trees the forest was. They brought camping gear with them to stay on-site since it was so remote.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That was as much of a scene as he was able to set. Again, not much of a storyteller, my dad. The story did get more interesting when he told me sleeping in the tent on the first night, he was awoken by a shotgun blast. He peeped his head outside the flap and saw his brother and a couple of the other workers. “Get back in the tent, Eddie!” His brother shouted. After a while, he went back to sleep.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The next day, he asked his brother what the hell all the commotion was about, but he had nothing to say. In my whole life, I think I can count on one hand the number of words I’ve heard my uncle utter, so this made sense. Dad brushed it off thinking maybe they were shooting at a coyote or something of the like.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the second night, dad had not so much as settled in his sleeping bag when he heard a strange, blood-curdling noise. Not content to stay in the tent this time, he crawled out to investigate. There again were his brother and another man, firing off a shotgun into the distance. It was then that he saw it. An eerie white light pulsed about ten feet away from them. It hovered, the shots having no effect. As it neared them, the men backed away in fear. My dad stood frozen, unable to square what he was seeing. It was in the shape of a man, but featureless, he described. Eventually, as if it grew bored, it faded back into the night.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My dad and his brother continued work on the house for another month but didn’t see the light again. They never discussed the incident amongst themselves.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When I pressed my dad for more details, he told me he had heard a story about an inn for travelers in that area. The owner supposedly murdered anyone who stayed at the inn and would sell their horses. He figured the bodies had been dumped there and maybe that’s what caused what he saw, but he really didn’t know.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I could tell my dad didn’t quite know what to make of it, having witnessed something he couldn’t explain.

Sometime after, I met Kirk Kiefer through an old friend of mine - quickly bonding over a mutual love of Batman comics. As it turned out, Kirk was also a well-rounded musician, playing bass and singing in the alt-country band Yardsale. After attending one of their shows, I got the itch to start playing music again.\n\nI revisited a few un-used Sad Bastard demos, and then started writing new material for the first time in over a year. About a month later, I had enough songs written to fill a new album, but had no desire to record it by myself. Brad and John (of the Sad Bastard Brothers) were far too busy to do any heavy lifting in a studio, so I asked Kirk to help out. Luckily for me, he agreed.\n\nSince our schedules were so hectic, we decided on a focused set of goals outside of the usual band dynamic. We would record one album and play one release show, knowing up front that this was a finite project. With those rules established, we rehearsed and arranged fourteen songs in a month or two, then started recruiting other musicians. Colin Garcia played drums for Yardsale, so Kirk and I politely asked he join us for the project. Colin’s creativity behind the drum kit added a new dimension to songs I had played by myself. Martha Manuel had sang backup vocals with the Sad Bastard Brothers a few times, and offered to contribute to the new album.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTWoWrhzGGQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>\u003C/iframe>\n\nOur newly formed group learned and arranged twelve songs in total. Every Wednesday for several months we’d get together above a Scuba shop in town to rehearse. It was a very different process from what I was used to with Sad Bastard Brothers, but it worked out well. We had lots of laughs and many great, unused band name ideas,\n\nI decided to call the band Secrets with Strangers. I felt it described what songwriting is to me: telling secrets to complete strangers without knowing how they’ll interpret it. The songs I wrote for From the Bar to the Bedroom center on the sea-change of you go through while exiting your twenties. I had hoped people could relate the awkward growing pains described by the lyrics.\n\nOnce the songs were in a good place, we booked studio time at FLD Studios, run by Jordan Forst. Kirk played bass for Jordan’s band Adventure at the time. The drums and bass were recorded digitally in under a weekend.\n\nFrom there, Kirk and I recorded the rest of the tracks at my apartment. I spent several weeks locked in my bedroom, playing my guitar loudly, to the exasperation of my neighbors.\n\n![Album Design](/img/project-2-albumcover.webp)\n\nChris Humphreys took some photos inside of the bar closest to my bedroom, Seidenfaden’s, which I used to design the sleeve.

Sometime after, I met Kirk Kiefer through an old friend of mine - quickly bonding over a mutual love of Batman comics. As it turned out, Kirk was also a well-rounded musician, playing bass and singing in the alt-country band Yardsale. After attending one of their shows, I got the itch to start playing music again.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I revisited a few un-used Sad Bastard demos, and then started writing new material for the first time in over a year. About a month later, I had enough songs written to fill a new album, but had no desire to record it by myself. Brad and John (of the Sad Bastard Brothers) were far too busy to do any heavy lifting in a studio, so I asked Kirk to help out. Luckily for me, he agreed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since our schedules were so hectic, we decided on a focused set of goals outside of the usual band dynamic. We would record one album and play one release show, knowing up front that this was a finite project. With those rules established, we rehearsed and arranged fourteen songs in a month or two, then started recruiting other musicians. Colin Garcia played drums for Yardsale, so Kirk and I politely asked he join us for the project. Colin’s creativity behind the drum kit added a new dimension to songs I had played by myself. Martha Manuel had sang backup vocals with the Sad Bastard Brothers a few times, and offered to contribute to the new album.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTWoWrhzGGQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>\u003C/iframe>\n\u003Cp>Our newly formed group learned and arranged twelve songs in total. Every Wednesday for several months we’d get together above a Scuba shop in town to rehearse. It was a very different process from what I was used to with Sad Bastard Brothers, but it worked out well. We had lots of laughs and many great, unused band name ideas,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I decided to call the band Secrets with Strangers. I felt it described what songwriting is to me: telling secrets to complete strangers without knowing how they’ll interpret it. The songs I wrote for From the Bar to the Bedroom center on the sea-change of you go through while exiting your twenties. I had hoped people could relate the awkward growing pains described by the lyrics.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Once the songs were in a good place, we booked studio time at FLD Studios, run by Jordan Forst. Kirk played bass for Jordan’s band Adventure at the time. The drums and bass were recorded digitally in under a weekend.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>From there, Kirk and I recorded the rest of the tracks at my apartment. I spent several weeks locked in my bedroom, playing my guitar loudly, to the exasperation of my neighbors.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/img/project-2-albumcover.webp\" alt=\"Album Design\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Chris Humphreys took some photos inside of the bar closest to my bedroom, Seidenfaden’s, which I used to design the sleeve.
