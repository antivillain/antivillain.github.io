I"’<p>As previously mentioned, ANTI-VILLAIN isnâ€™t a real company, record label, or publishing house. That said, I do use the name as a brand to release my creative projects. When I started self-publishing media, I found the package design was more compelling with a company logo attached.</p>

<p>I created the name in response to the over-abundance of anti-heroes in popular media. The concept of an anti-villain is still a trope unto itself, but used more rarely. Also, Iâ€™ve loved comics since I was five, so the concept naturally appealed to me.</p>

<p>This site exists to promote new work by yours truly.</p>

<h2 id="and-who-am-i">And who am I?</h2>

<p>Also previously mentioned, Iâ€™m Shawn Coots. You can learn more about my professional experience at my other <a href="https://shawncoots.com">website</a>.</p>

<p>I live in Louisville, Kentucky with my lovely wife, two small children and one grey cat named Grey Cat.</p>

<p>Back in the 90â€™s, I went to art school and studied Graphic Design. That experience introduced me to the wonder of Apple Computers. With an Apple, I could design things, of course, but I could also edit videos, record music, write novels, color comics, or whatever else I was interested in that particular day. My adaptability landed me jobs in multimedia and web agencies where I was considered the in-house jack-of-all-trades.</p>

<p>Rarely - if ever - did agency work satisfy my creative interests. A working designerâ€™s ego is best left at the door, as paying clients will likely trample your creative spirit. To sustain said spirit, Iâ€™ve worked with numerous friends and collaborators on sad bastard music, public-access comedy shows, sci-fi movies, secret agent comics, wine bar logos, and the odd podcast guest appearance, here and there. The only thing I havenâ€™t done yet is compete in a monster truck show, but Iâ€™m not dead yet.</p>

<p>Thank you for spending time on this site.</p>
