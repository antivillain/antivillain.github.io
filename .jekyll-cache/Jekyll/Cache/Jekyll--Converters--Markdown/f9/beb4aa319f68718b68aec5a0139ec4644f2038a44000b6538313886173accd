<p>When Matt Dobson started a local paper, he kindly asked me to write a sci-fi serial adventure for it. I jumped at the chance, and each month, a contributed a chapter. Once the story wrapped, Matt designed a cover, and we released the collection as an eBook.</p>

<p>My old friend, Deathmetal Dave, has been telling us for years to make a movie about him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too good looking not to be on film,‚Äù he‚Äôd say. Finally, I caved. I wrote and directed this short film, then convinced my friends to act in it. Seidenfaden‚Äôs was kind enough to let us film in their bar. Matt Real handled Director of Photography and editing duties.</p>
